Thanks for checking out my project!

# Installation:

* Install Python 3.9.1 from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/), or the Windows Store
* Navigate to your install directory using `cd` and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in Command Prompt

# Launch Bot:
* Open Settings and reset to default settings
* In settings, Set to Windowed Mode
* In settings, Set to lowest resolution
* In settings, Set to lowest graphic settings
* In primary monitor, move the game window to allign with the top left corner
* Unpin all quests
* Open map and set yellow marker to the location of the hotspot or fishing spot
* Verify yellow marker alligns with the location of the hostpot or fishing spot
* Press F3 to pull out fishing Rod and face the yellow marker
* Navigate to your install directory using `cd` and run `py "run.py"` in Command Prompt
* Follow the remaining instructions in Command Prompt

# Troubleshooting:

* If these steps don't work, try running the file with `python "run.py"` instead (For Windows Store/MacOS/Linux users especially) Likewise, try `pip3` instead of `pip` for installing requirements.
* If pip doesn't seem to exist, try installing it [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). Essentially 'save as' from [here](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py), then run `py get-pip.py` and try to use pip again
* The bot is configured to work with in-game resolution 1920x1080, and League client resolution 1280x720. You can switch this up though, just re-capture the images in the captures folder!
* If you're having issues with Python not working properly, please make sure you have the correct version (3.8.3) installed, and all of the correct module versions installed, as listed in requirements.txt
* Make sure to run New World on your main monitor, as it doesn't support additional monitors!
If you need additional help, feel free to reach out to me via an [issue](https://github.com/connorhamm/NWFishBot/issues).
